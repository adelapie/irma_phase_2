============

Implementation of complex NIPKs in embedded devices.

#### Optimizations

- fortuna-only: Utilization of a PRNG for recomputing
pseudorandomness during the generation of both t-/s-values.

#### Protocol extensions

- nyms: Idemix standard pseudonyms.
- dnym: Idemix standard psudonyms in combination with domain ones.


#### Multi-credential proofs

- eq_proof_a: Equality proof of representation across n credentials (2).
- eq_proof_b: Equality proof of representation across 2 credentials.
